I recently completed a data visualization project using Microsoft Power BI, focused on analyzing UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions to uncover key insights about digital payment trends across different banks, cities, and payment methods.

ðŸ“Š Project Highlights:

Achieved a comprehensive dashboard visualizing UPI transaction performance metrics.

Analyzed transaction success vs failure rates, payment methods, and user demographics.

Identified that Phone Number was the most preferred payment method.

Observed Delhi and Mumbai leading in transaction volumes.

Derived key financial metrics:

ðŸ’° Total Transaction Amount: 19.87M

ðŸ’¸ Average Remaining Balance: 5.02K

ðŸ§  Skills & Tools Used:

Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Dashboard Design)

Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)

Data Visualization (KPIs, charts, slicers, and dynamic filters)

This project enhanced my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights, supporting data-driven decision-making.

Iâ€™m continuously working on developing advanced analytics projects that combine data storytelling and business intelligence to drive actionable insights.
